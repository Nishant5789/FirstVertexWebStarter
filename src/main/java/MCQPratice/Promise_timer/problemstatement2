Problem Statement:
Create a simple Vert.x Timer-based Async Workflow that demonstrates various Vert.x Future methods.

A Verticle schedules a timer (using setTimer()) to simulate an asynchronous task.
The task succeeds or fails based on a condition.
Various Future methods are used to process the outcome.

Concepts Covered:
setTimer() → Simulates async task.
Future.compose() → Chains another future.
onSuccess() → Handles success.
onFailure() → Handles failure.
onComplete() → Runs after success/failure.
eventually() → Cleanup action.
otherwise() → Provides default value in case of failure.
flatMap() → Transforms result.
toCompletionStage() → Converts Future to Java's CompletionStage.
